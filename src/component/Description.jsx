                 </ul>
                 <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                 <ol>
                    <li>To make the groundnut soup, heat a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the chopped onion, minced garlic, and grated ginger. Sauté until the onions are translucent and the garlic and ginger are fragrant.</li>
                    <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and scotch bonnet pepper (if using). Sauté until the tomatoes are soft and have released their juices.</li>
                    <li>Add the tomato paste and ground peanuts to the pot. Stir to combine and cook for a few minutes until the mixture starts to thicken.</li>
                    <li>Add 2 cups of water or chicken broth to the pot, along with the cubed beef or chicken (if using). Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the meat is tender.</li>
                    <li>If using, add salt, pepper, ground crayfish, and palm oil to the pot. Stir to combine and cook for another 5-10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>To make the rice balls, bring 4 cups of water to a boil in a separate pot. Gradually add the cornmeal to the boiling water, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Reduce the heat to low and continue to stir until the mixture thickens and becomes smooth.</li>
                    <li>Wet your hands with water and shape the cornmeal mixture into small balls.</li>
                    <li>Serve the groundnut soup hot with the rice balls on the side. Enjoy!</li>
